# dr_mauro

* DR. Mauro:
 a Dr Mario clone written as final project for Programming Course CT0304 taken in 2018

** My Code:
The game logic in the =drmauro.c= file:
1. Implemented the functions to load and generate the game state
2. Implemented the game logic as the =step= function
3. Implemented the victory check

Run the game:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ make
$ ./drmauro
#+END_EXAMPLE
